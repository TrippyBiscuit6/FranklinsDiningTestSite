# Practical PHP Course Project
This website is a dynamic site utilizing PHP to create a restaurant test site.
This course was done on Udemy and was presented by Brad Hussey.

The project used nothing but PHP and HTML.
Tested on a local server using MAMP. 
No plans to host this site at the current time, but will host as soon as a portfolio site is made.
